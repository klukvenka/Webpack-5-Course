** Implementation here is not important. The main focus is adding css loader**

It is the same application as in the section "1. Getting Started" + some css

1. run `npm run build` to compile the code with webpack
2. Open index.html to see the page

The css loaders that are used were installed by running `npm i --save-dev css-loader style-loader`
