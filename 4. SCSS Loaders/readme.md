`Note: the implementation here is not important. The main focus is adding scss loader`

It is the same application as in the section "1. Getting Started // 3. CSS Loaders" + some scss

1. run `npm run build` to compile the code with webpack
2. Open index.html to see the page

The scss loaders that are used were installed by running
`npm i -D sass-loader sass`
