** Implementation here is not important. The main focus is adding image loader**

It is the same application as in the section "4. SCSS Loaders" + image loader

Note: for the image loaders we donâ€™t have to download any additional packages

1. run `npm run build` to compile the code with webpack
2. Open index.html to see the page
